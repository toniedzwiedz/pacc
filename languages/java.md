# PACC Java

You're reading the Java version of PACC, the _Passive Aggressive Coding Conventions_. The set of guidelines is based on the [_Google Java Style Guide_](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html). The PACC version has been found to be particularly effective among teams that don't see blindly mimicking Google as an end in itself.

## Terminology

The terminology is quite obvious. Every reasonably smart Java developer would probably skip it anyway. It's fine if you look it up somewhere. Do you think they should be described here? I'll respect you if you just tell me. It's not like I'm the one looking for a fight.

## Source file basics

You know that a `*.java` file needs to contain a public class with a name matching that of a file, right? That's impressive for someone on your level.

Use UFT-8 encoding.

Okay, so that was a typo. I'm sorry but you just want everything to be perfect. Thankfully, this is on GitHub so somone who actually cares can fix it.
