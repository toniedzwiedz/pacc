# PACC

Every organisation that treats programming seriously has some Coding Conventions that are promoted among development teams. However, according to _science_, software engineers tend to be extremely opinionated. A lot of debates regarding code style will never reach a conclusion. For example, look at the primordial _tabs vs. spaces_ argument that is still widely considered open (despite the fact that tabs are obviously superior in most cases).

A lot of organisations try to solve such conundrums by brutally enforcing a specific standard, hoping that their engineers will bend to their will. Usually, this is not the case. Software developers can go to great lenghts to prove other people wrong.

There is, however, a very effective way to enforce arbitrary Coding Standards regardless of the persistence of your team. Its power lies in utilising the relatively low levels of social intelligence among software geeks. The idea is to make them as uncomfortable arguing against the coding conventions enforced as to give up. The social awkwardness of going against the guidelines needs to be stronger than the natural drive to do thingsthe _right_ way.

Enter _Passive Aggressive Coding Conventions (PACC)_

PACC is a set of popular coding conventions documented in a way that makes up to 90% of software engineers grudgingly accept them.

The language doesn't matter, PACC is polyglot. Think of it as a framework for harnessing passive aggression to enforce standards. What ruins relationships around the world can, when properly channeled, save millions of dollars and thousands of man-hours of _trite whining_.
